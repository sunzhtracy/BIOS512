A patch represents the difference between two versions of a file - what lines were added, removed, or modified. When I make a commit in Git, I am essentially saving a patch (a set of differences) that describes how to transform the previous state of my project into the new one. Over time, these patches form a continuous history of changes in my repository.","metadata":{}},{"id":"9aa99e0b-8fbe-4ccc-a728-b39b1fda153c","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Question 3\n#### What is the difference between a branch and a fork?\nA branch is a pointer to a specific series of commits within the same repository. It’s a temporary and flexible way to develop new features or experiments without affecting the main codebase. A fork, on the other hand, is a permanent copy of an entire repository that exists independently of the original.","metadata":{}},{"id":"c6ac98c7-e4ea-4274-a88d-398cb739fab9","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Question 4\n#### How are diff and patch related? What’s the difference?\nThe diff command shows the differences between two versions of a file or set of files-it produces a “patch file” that records the changes needed to go from version A to version B. The patch command then takes that patch file and applies the recorded changes to transform one version into the other.","metadata":{}},{"id":"02988321-54d5-4086-a62f-d6f7a5961c22","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Question 5\n#### See the diagram below.\n```\nalice            *-*-*-*-d-e     \nbob              *-*-*-*-a-b-c\norigin/main      *-*-*-*-a-b-c\n```\n#### a) What part of the Git trininty does each line represent?\nBranch.\n#### b) What would the result be if Alice performed a rebase?

It lets you carefully select which specific parts (“hunks”) of your edits to include in each commit without having to undo or redo changes manually.\n#### b) What command(s) help you prepare for what you'll see while interactive staging? \n*Hint*: Check the TA notes.\n```\ngit status\ngit diff\n```\n#### b) What git command would you use to start interactive staging?\ngit add -i\n#### c) On the text-based interactive menu, what option do you use?\nOn the text-based interactive menu that appears, you choose option p for “patch.” This allows you to review and select specific parts of changes (hunks) within a file.\n#### d) After pressing that option, how do you select the file you want to stage?\nAfter selecting p, Git will show a list of changed files and ask which one you want to review. You type the number corresponding to the file you want to stage, then press Enter.\n#### e) What option do you type if you do not want to stage a hunk?\nIf you do not want to stage a hunk, you type n and press Enter.\n#### f) Once you get to a hunk you want to stage, what do you do?\nOnce you get to a hunk you do want to stage, you type y and press Enter.\n#### g) What if we have more hunks we want to stage?\nContinue typing y for each desired hunk.","metadata":{}}]}
